A set of SQL queries that transform raw CouchDB data into a more useful format for analytics. It uses `dbt` to define the models that are translated into PostgreSQL tables or views, which makes it easier to query the data in the analytics platform of choice.

## Setup
Follow the instructions in [the CHT Sync documentation](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/hosting/analytics/) to set up the data pipeline.

## Run dbt models unit tests locally

### Prerequisites
- `Docker`

### Run the tests

1. Navigate to `tests` folder.
2. Run the test script:

```sh
# set environment variables, install dbt dependencies, seed data, run dbt, run test
./run_dbt_tests.sh
```

## Release Process
This repo has an automated release process where each feature/bug fix will be released immediately after it is merged to `main`. The release type is determined by the commit message format. Have a look at the development workflow in the [Contributor Handbook](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/contribute/code/workflow/) for more information.
